The project trains a simple decision tree clasifier and exposes it as a
tool that LLM can use in order to recomment TV shows based on age and sex.

tv.csv: The dataset used used for training of the clasifier.

life_table.csv: A dataset containing acurate statistics regarding life
expectancy.

The columns are as follows
* age - The age of the person
* sex - 1 means male, 0 - means female
* risk - the probability the person will die this year
* alive - The number of people of that age, out of 100k, still alive
* expectation - The life expectancy

Ex.: I'm born 1974, so I'm 51. There is 0.006069 chance I'll die this
year. Out of 100 000, botn in 1974, 89955 are still alive.  And the expectation
is that I'll live 28.22 more years
